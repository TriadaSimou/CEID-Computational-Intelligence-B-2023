# CEID-Computational-Intelligence-B-2023
This is a repository for the development of a Genetic Algorithm that computes the optimum solution vector for the implementation of a movement. The GA is supposed to
find the best values a vector of sensor data should have, to implement the movement "sitting". 

Project part of Computational Intelligence course. CEID University of Patras.
